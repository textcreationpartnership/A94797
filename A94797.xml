            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Men wrap themſelves in excuſes, as they do their hands, to defend them from pricks.

               <p>HEre God reneweth the world by the ſame word wherewith he had created it; and being reconciled to mankinde, he bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them in like manner, as before the Fall.

               <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>Every moving thing that liveth ſhall be meat for you</hi>] God of his goodneſs grants here to mankinde, after the flood the uſe of fleſh and wine, that the new and much-weakned world might have new and more ſtrengthning nouriſhment. For it is not to be doubted, but that by the deluge, a great decay was wrought both in the earth with its fruits, and alſo in mans nature. Divers wales and ſcarres as it were, of Gods wrath and malediction did abide and appear in the earth. Sundry maladies alſo and infirmities befell mans body, not felt before the flood. God therefore in great mercy provides, <hi>penu quoddam &amp; pharmacopolium mundo ſeneſcenti,</hi> new food and phyſick for the languiſhing world. <hi>Every moving thing that liveth, &amp;c.</hi> Onely, <hi>as the green herb have I given you all things.</hi> That is, as you may uſe them as freely as you uſed to do herbes, ſo you muſt uſe them ſoberly, and without curioſity; taking ſuch things as are at hand, and eating to live, not living to eat, as the rich glutton, that fared deliciouſly every day; <q>

               <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>But fleſh with the life thereof, the blood</hi>] Blood was forbidden, Firſt, as not ſo wholſome food. Secondly, leſt by being fleſht in blood, they ſhould become bloody minded. Thirdly, blood, the organ of life, is holy to God the authour of life (who was alſo to be pacified by the blood of his Son) and therefore they ſhould not pollute or prophane it, by devouring thereof.</p>

               <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>Who ſo ſheddeth mans blood</hi>] Some are of opinion, that before the flood, the puniſhment of murther and other capitall crimes, was onely excommunication, and excluſion from the Church and their fathers family. And that now firſt, God made murther to be a matter of death. The firſt-born had power, at firſt, over their own families, to bleſs, curſe, caſt out, diſ-inherit, yea and puniſh with death, <hi>Gen.</hi> 38.24. even in caſe of adultery,

               <head>CHAP. XXII. Verſ. 1. <hi>God did tempt Abraham</hi>]</head>
               <p>TEmptation is twofold; 1. <hi>Probationis.</hi> 2. <hi>Perditionis.</hi> The former is of God, the latter of the devill. God is ſaid to tempt, when he puts us upon the triall of our faith and obedience, that he may <hi>do us good in the latter end, Deut.</hi> 8.26. Satan ever ſeeks to do us hurt. He, when he comes to tempt, comes with his ſieve as to <hi>Peter.</hi> Chriſt with his fan, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.12. Now a Fan caſteth out the worſt, and keepeth in the beſt; a Sieve keepeth in the worſt,
<note place="margin">D. <hi>Playfere.</hi>
                  </note> and caſteth out the beſt. Right ſo Chriſt (and histrials) purgeth out corruption, and increaſeth grace: contrarily the Devill, if there be any ill thing in us, confirmeth it; if faith, or any good thing in us, he weakneth it. Now the temptations of Satan are either, 1. Of ſeducement, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.15. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r 2. of buffetting and grievance, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. In ſeducement we are preſſed with ſome leſſer or darling corruption, whereto our appetites by nature are moſt propenſe. And here Satan hath his machinations, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. methods, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.11. depths, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.24. darts, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.16. fiery darts pointed and poyſoned with the venome of Serpents, which ſet the heart on fire from one luſt to another. In buffettings we are dogg'd with fouleſt luſts of Atheiſme, ſelf-murther, &amp;c. ſuch as Nature ſtartleth at, and abhorreth; and theſe, if we reſiſt, and be meerly paſſive, are onely our croſſes, Satans ſins. For before a temptation can be a ſin, it muſt have ſomewhat of coveting in it. And trialls are onely taps to give vent to corruption.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>Take now thy ſon, thine onely ſon Iſaac, &amp;c.</hi>] This was the laſt of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ten trialls, and the foreſt. All our troubles to this, are but as the ſlivers and chips of that croſs, upon which this good Patriarch was crucified. <hi>Origen</hi> hence perſwades parents to bear patiently the loſs of their children. <hi>Laetus offer filium Deo, eſto ſacerdos animae filii tui, &amp;c. Abraham</hi> was not onely to kill his onely ſon (which yet was more then to have tome out his own heart, with his own hands) but to cut him in peeces, to lay him orderly on the Altar, after the manner of a ſacrifice, and to burn him to aſhes; himſelf making and tending the fire, and putting him in, piece after piece, when any was out. A hard and heavy task; eſpecially, ſince it directly croſſed the promiſe, that in <hi>Iſaac
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:115808:90"/>all nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed;</hi> and ſeemed to involve the utter ruine of all mankinde. Here Reaſon was at a ſtand: It was faith onely that could extricate the perplexed Patriarch, by giving him to know that God was able to raiſe him up even from the dead, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.19. <hi>Hoc, Abrahamum fecit,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. This was it that kept him from tripping. <hi>[Get thee into the Land of Moriah]</hi> Both <hi>Abrahams</hi> great temptations began with one ſtrain <hi>vade tibi,</hi> Get thee gone, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.2 Here God led <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> into temptation, but delivered him from evill. Have you not been tempted (ſaith a Holy man) in this or that kinde? It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God in mercy would not <hi>lead you into temptation.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Baines</hi> Letters.</note> Yea this is in ſome ſort more to be acknowledged then victory, when you are tempted. For not to be tempted is more immediately from God, and leſs in mans power then to prevail againſt temptation: Sith nothing doth overcome us againſt our will: but without our will God doth lead us into triall: for he knoweth we would taſte little of theſe if we might be our own carvers.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>And Abraham roſe up early, &amp;c.]</hi> To ſhew his prompt and preſent obedience. He neither conſulted with his wife, nor with his own reaſon.
<note place="margin">Exod. 4.</note> She might have haply hung upon him and hindered him, as <hi>Zipporah</hi> did <hi>Moſes</hi> to the hazarding of his life. He captivates all the powers of the ſoul to his Creator, goes after him without ſciſcitation, and ſo ſhews himſelf to be renewed <hi>in the spirit of his minde;</hi> that is, in his naturall reaſon: for that like an old Beldam, is the mother and nurſe of all our diſtempers and outſtrayes. <hi>Caſſianus</hi> tells us of a young man that had given himſelf up to a Chriſtian life: And his parents,
<note place="margin">Caſſianus.</note> miſliking that way, wrote letters to diſſwade him from it; which when he knew, he would not once open them, but threw them in the fire. Let us do ſo, by the ſuggeſtions of fleſh and blood, and the counſell of carnall friends, or we ſhall never reſt and feaſt in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome. I know not by what reaſon (ſaid <hi>Borthwick</hi> the Scotch Martyr) they ſo called them my friends,

               <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>Then on the third day</hi>] A great while for him to be plodding, ere he came to the place. But we muſt conceive that his brains were better buſied, then many of ours would have been therewhile. We muſt not weigh the croſs, for then it will prove<pb n="172" facs="tcp:115808:91"/>heavy: we muſt not chew the pill, but ſwallow it whole, elſe it will prove bitter. We muſt not plod too much, but ply the Throne of Grace for a good uſe and a good iſſue of all our trialls and tribulations.</p>

The miſerable man therefore, looking at and lamenting both his ſons, could not finde in his heart to make choice of either (as overcome with an equall love to them both) but ſtood doubting and deliberating, till they were both ſlain. At the ſiege of <hi>Buda</hi> in <hi>Hungary</hi> there was among the <hi>German</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a Noble-man, called <hi>Erkius Raſchachius,</hi> whoſe ſon a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant young Gentleman being got out of the Army without his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers knowledge, bore himſelf ſo gallantly in fight againſt the enemy, in the ſight of his father and the Army, that he was highly commended of all men, and eſpecially of his father that knew him not at all.

               <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>And Jacob ſtole away</hi>] Gods Saints are put upon the uſe of ſuch means ſometimes, for their own ſafety, as render them contemptible to worldly men. All whoſe contumelies they can bravely bear, ſo long as their conſciences clear and chear them: yea, then can rejoyce, and ſay, It is a mercy they know no worſe by me. It is a great work of nature, to keep the filth of the body, when it is in man, from being unſavoury to others. But it is a greater work of God to keep the filth of the ſoul, that is ſo unſavoury to him, from the knowledge of thoſe that wait all occaſions to blaze and blaſpheme us.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>Theſe are the generations</hi>] That is, events, begotten of time, after he came to live with his father <hi>Iſaac,</hi> who alſo wept for <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> verſ. 35, as <hi>Iunius.</hi> [<hi>With the ſons of Bilhah,</hi> &amp;c.] It is thought, that theſe ſons of the handmaids, for the baſeneſs of their birth, were more modeſt then the reſt; and that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> therefore, out of his humility, ſorted himſelf with them. Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it is, they were more unruly then the reſt, and ill conditioned, (as ſuch are, commonly) whereof <hi>Ioſeph</hi> made complaint, and was therefore hated. <hi>Veritas odium parit.</hi> Truth is a good miſtreſs; but he that follows her too cloſe at heels, may hap have his teeth ſtruck out. <hi>An expectas ut Quintilianus ametur?</hi> ſaid he. Thoſe that are wakened out of ſleep, are uſually unquiet, ready to brawl with their beſt friends. So here.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 3. <hi>Becauſe he was the ſon of his old-age</hi>] The Chaldee Paraphraſt renders it morally, Becauſe he was a wiſe ſon, <hi>in quo ante canos ſapientia:</hi> ſuch a one as <hi>Macarius</hi> was, of whom <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephorus</hi> ſaith, that, for his prudence and gravity, whiles he was yet but a youth, he was ſirnamed <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>The old ſtripling. Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi> ſaith, He was very like his mother, <hi>Rachel;</hi> and therefore his father ſo loved him. But <hi>Chryſostome</hi> ſaith, better, that it was for his vertuous life, and godly diſpoſition. Goodneſs is lovely in any, much more in an own childe. <hi>Iohn</hi> was the beſt beloved diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, becauſe beſt conditioned. But otherwiſe, <hi>Cavete,</hi> ſaith <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, ne quos natura conjunxit, paterna gratia dividat.</hi> Parents partiality, may breed heart-burnings, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.4.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>They hated him</hi>] There is a paſſion of hatred: This is a kinde of averſneſs, and riſing of the heart againſt a man, when
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:115808:148"/>one ſeeth him; ſo that he cannot away with him, nor ſpeak to him, nor look courteouſly or peaceably upon him; but ones coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance falls when he ſees him, and he even turns away, and, by his good will, would have nothing to do with him. 2. There is a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of hatred: when the ſoul is ſo ſowred with this leven, ſo ſetled in this alienation and eſtrangement, that it grows to wiſh, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and ſeek his hurt. And this is one difference betwixt Hatred and Envie: whom men hate, they will harm; but ſometimes mens gifts are envied, againſt whom no hurt is intended.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>And Ioſeph dreamed</hi>] Of divine dreams to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as Oracles, ſee the Notes on Chap. 20. verſ. 3. <hi>[They hated him yet the more]</hi> So the Jews did Jeſus, for his parables; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, when he ſpake of his exaltation.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>We were binding ſheaves</hi>] This was fulfilled, when they came to him for corn into <hi>Egypt.</hi> Here <hi>Ioſeph</hi> dreams of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, but not of his impriſonment: So do many profeſſors, which therefore prove apoſtates.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>Shalt thou indeed raign over us?]</hi> They rightly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted the dream, yet ſtubbornly reſiſt the revealed will of God. This leaves ſin without a cloke, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.22, as it did in the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees. They rightly interpreted that place in <hi>Micah,</hi> Matth. 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet, when Chriſt, to whom all their own ſignes did ſo well agree, came amongſt them, they would by no means receive him; nay, they ſent a meſſage after him, ſaying, <hi>We will not have this man to raign over us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>Beheld, the ſun, and the moon</hi>] The father of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhould be as the ſun, full of heavenly light, and illightning all about him: The mother, as the moon, ſhining out in her husbands abſence, and veiling to him, when he is in place. The children, as ſtars of light, or rather, as a heaven full of ſtars, as one ſaith well of <hi>Ioſeph: Fuit Ioſephi vita coelum quoddam lucidiſſimis virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ſtellis exornatum.</hi> The people of God are called, <hi>the host of heaven,</hi> Dan. 8.10: and are bid to ſhine as lamps, or rather, as thoſe great lights of heaven, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.15.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And his father rebuked him</hi>] Either as not yet under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the myſtery, or diſſembling it. It is wiſdom, at ſome time, and in ſome place, to pretend a diſlike of another mans fact, (ſo far as we may with truth) for the preventing of envie. This, ſome think, was <hi>Iacobs</hi> drift here. And therefore he draws an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, <hi>ab impoſſibili &amp; abſurdo;</hi> Shall thy dead mother riſe and
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:115808:149"/>reverence thee? A likely matter: and yet, as light as <hi>Iacob</hi> made of it, (to deonerate <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of the envie) he laid it to heart, verſ. 11.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And his brethren envied him</hi>] Envie is a filthy fruit of the fleſh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.25. and the devil; who is called, <hi>the envious man,</hi> Matth. 13.20. and ſuch wiſdom is ſaid to be <hi>devilliſh,</hi> Jam. 3.15. The Phariſees, envying our Saviour, did the <hi>devils Work,</hi> Joh. 8. So did <hi>Cain,</hi> the devils Patriarch, when he laid his cruel club on the innocent head of his brother <hi>Abel.</hi> And <hi>Saul,</hi> when ſeized upon by the evil ſpirit, (more then a melancholy humour) he envied <hi>David,</hi> and ſought his death. For, this vice, as it makes the heart to boil with helliſh venom; ſo it bliſters out at the tongue, as here; <hi>They could not ſpeak peaceably</hi> to <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> but ſcoff, and conſult his ruine.

                  <p>It was likewiſe unlawful to make a covenant with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites, whom God had curſed: to make mixtures of diverſ kindes of creatures, &amp;c. whereby they are taught ſinceritie in Religion and converſation.</p>
                  <p>To the ſecond Commandement: God commanded to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Images, Pictures, Idolatrous temples, Altars, Groves, &amp;c. and forbad them, upon pain of death, to bow to Sun, Moon, or anie other ſtrange gods; becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> his politie could not conſiſt of true worſhippers, and profeſſed Idolaters.</p>
                  <p>To the third Commandement: there were two kindes of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:115808:232"/>blaſphemie or curſing of God; (whether it were mediate or immediate, direct or indirect) One proceeding of inſirmitie and impatience, the other of malice and obſtinacie. This later was to bee puniſhed with ſtoning: that former with ſom cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral puniſhment; as, beating, boring the tongue, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>To the fourth Commandement: The wilful profanation of the Sabbath was puniſhed with death. Tithes, Offerings, Firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruits, Firſtlings, and the like, were commanded by God, as part of the Prieſt's maintenance, due to them by the verie law of Nature. And the ſame cuſtom is at this daie commendably kept up, there not beeing a more equal and eaſie waie of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining the Miniſters of the Church, and ſo of upholding the Church's Miniſterie.</p>
                  <p>To the fifth Commandement: Wrong don to a Parent (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſtriking or curſing) is parricide, and to bee puniſhed with death: ſo is wrong offered to the chief Magiſtrate; this is treaſon. Parents had power to command and correct their children, yea, in ſom caſes, to ſell them to their brethren the Iſraëlites, and to ſue out a Writ of Execution againſt them, if uncounſellable and incorrigible.</p>
                  <p>The Privilege of Primogeniture made for the honor of the familie, and prefigured hriſt.</p>

                  <p>Man-ſlaughter was committed either by man or beaſt. If by a man, either it was voluntarie; and that was puniſhed with death: or involuntarie; and in that caſe, they had their cities of Refuge: theſe prefigured Chriſt, our ſole Sanctuarie of ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.

                  <p>Blows that cauſſed loſs of limbs, were puniſhed with the like loſs; or if not, with a reaſonable recompenſ.</p>

                  <p>Hereto alſo pertein their laws for War: as, that new-mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried men, timorous perſons, and plough-men ſhould bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed; that a ſouldier ſhould bee twentie years of age at leaſt; that the General ſhould deſire paſſage through his brother's countrie; that hee ſhould ſend forth ſpies; offer peace; lead on his ſouldiers; uſe ſtratagems; ſpare fruit-trees, equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the ſpoil; reſerv a part thereof for God; ſee that the Camp bee kept clean from ſin, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>To the ſeventh Commandement: Adulterie was death: and, in the High-prieſt's daughter, Fornication was burning; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſ hee was a ſpecial type of Chriſt, and therefore his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie ſhould bee without blame or blemiſh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sodomie</hi> and beſtialitie were likewiſe death: ſo was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flouring of an eſpouſed virgin, and a rape.</p>
                  <p>The Prieſt might not marrie anie, but a virgin.</p>
                  <p>The price of an harlot might not bee brought into the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarie. Polygamie and Divorce were permitted onely, and not commanded.</p>
                  <p>Marrying with the brother's widdow was peculiar to the old Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>They were to marrie within their own tribes; becauſ our Lord was to ſpring of the Tribe of <hi>Judah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hee that defiled a virgin, was both to marrie her, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow her, ſo that hee had her parents conſent thereunto.</p>

                  <p>To the eighth Commandement: Man-ſtealing, Sacrilege, and compound theft, were puniſhed with death.</p>
                  <p>Uſurie is condemned by the Law of God.</p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:115808:233"/>
                  <p>The Law for things borrowed, depoſited, intruſted, lent, or found, is grounded upon this Rule. Hee that marreth another man's goods, robbeth him.</p>
                  <p>God would not have anie poor (that is, ſturdie beggers) amongſt his people.</p>

                  <p>The Laver wherein the Prieſts waſhed themſelves before they miniſtred in the Tabernacle, ſignified, that wee cannot draw nigh to God in his ſervices, without due preparation.</p>
                  <p>The outer Court ſignified the viſible Church, wherein hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites alſo partake of external privileges.</p>
                  <p>Lo, theſe are the things typed out by the Tabernacle: and and they cannot bee better underſtood then by God's own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of them, when hee ſaith. <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. <hi>Let them make mee a Sanctuarie that I may dwell in the middeſt of them.</hi> For in thoſe words (as learned <hi>Junius</hi> obſerveth) is conteined an explication of all the above-ſaid Cerimonies.</p>

                  <head>SECT. IIII. <hi>Treating of Holie Times.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>COncerning holie Times, the Law is either general or ſpecial.</p>
                  <p>The general Law is, partly, concerning the moſt ſtrict reſt from all ſervile works; and partly concerning the Sacrifices which were on thoſe holie daies to bee offered. The former figured that Reſt, whereunto God in his due time will bring us.</p>
                  <p>The later ſerved not onely to exerciſe the Jews (prone to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs) with the hard yoke of great expenſ; but alſo, by the great charge they were at, to ſhadow out the great worth of Chriſt, far beyond all worldly treaſures.</p>
                  <p>The ſpecial Law concerned, 1. holie Daies. 2. Holie Years. Holie-daies were either quotidian, or ſolemn. And theſe later were partly the New-moons, partly the Sabbath, and partly the Feaſts; which Feaſts were either more ſolemn; as the Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, Pentecoſt, and Feaſt of Tabernacles; or leſs ſolemn; as the Feaſt of Trumpets, and the Feaſt of Attonement.</p>
                  <p>Holie years, were 1. the Sabbatical or ſeventh year. Or, 2. the Jubilee or fiftieth year.</p>
                  <p>The explication of all theſe is, as followeth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The continual Sacrifice was offered twice everie daie; that the people might, everie morning and evening, bee admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed of their ſin-guiltineſs: and withal, might bee exerciſed in the remembrance and belief of the continual ſacrifice of Chriſt for their ſin. It ſignified alſo our daily ſervice, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual ſacrifice of Praiſ and Holineſs, offered up to God in the name of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The New-moon-ſacrifice ſerved to ſet forth, that all our time, and actions don therein, are ſanctified unto us by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Sabbath was a memorial of the Creätion: it was alſo a type partly of Chriſt's reſting in the grave, and partly of our reſt in Chriſt; the begining whereof wee have here, the perfection of it in heaven. And whereas ſpecial order was taken, that no fire ſhould bee kindled on that daie; it was to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115808:235"/>ſignifie that Chriſt his reſt, and ours in him, was, and ſhould bee free from the fire of affliction.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The holie Feaſts were (in general) appointed for theſe ends and uſes. 1. To diſtinguiſh the people of God from other nations. 2. To keep afoot the remembrance of benefits alreadie received. 3. To bee a type and ſigure of b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nefits yet further to bee conferred upon them by Chriſt. 4. To unite God's people in holie worſhips. 5. To preſerv puritie in holie wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips preſcribed by God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Paſſover of thoſe that were clean, celebrated in the begining of the year, figured out the time, manner, and fruit of Chriſt's Paſſion. The Paſſover kept by thoſe that had been unclean, ſignified, that Chriſt profiteth not ſinners as long as they perſiſt in their uncleanneſs: and ſo it figured out the time of repentance.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. At the Feaſt of Pentecoſt, there was a daie of waving and of offering the Firſt-fruits. The former ſignified, that the handful of our fruits, that is, our faith and good works are not accepted of God, unleſs they bee waved by Chriſt, our High-prieſt. The later, that God's bleſſings are to bee joyfully and thankfully received, and remembred.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The Feaſt of Tabernacles, beſides that it brought to minde the Iſraëlites wandering in the wilderneſs, it did nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſet forth the Church's pilgrimage in this preſent world; which yet is ſo to bee thought on, as that, with greateſt ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual joie, wee remember and celebrate our Redemption by Chriſt's death.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The Feaſt of Trumpets ſignified that continual cauſ of cheerfulneſs and thankfulneſs, that the Saints ſhould have by Chriſt's death.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The Feaſt of Attonement ſignified, that the ſins of God's people in their holie-meetings, and daily ſervices, ſhould bee expiated by Chriſt. Moreover, Attonement was alſo made for the moſt holie Place, and for the Sanctuarie. That ſignified, that the viſible heaven alſo was defiled by our ſin, and need bee purged by Chriſt's blood. This, that the Catholick Church is by the ſame blood of Chriſt made alone acceptable to God. By the application that was made for ſeveral perſons, was ſet forth the applicatorie force of faith. Furthermore, that applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and expiation was made by a live and a ſlain goat. Upon
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:115808:236"/>the live goat (called the ſcape-goat) were put the offenſes of the Children of Iſraël; and the goat thus Cerimonially laden, was let go into the wilderneſs: the other goat was ſet apart for a whole-burnt-offering. The former Cerimonie ſignified, that the Son of God came down from heaven into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this world, that hee might take away the ſins of the world: The later ſhadowed out the blood of Chriſt, which alone cleanſeth us from all ſin.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. The ſeventh-year-Sabbath had both an Eccleſiaſtical and a Civil uſe. For 1. it did ſet forth and commend to the people the ſpiritual Sabbath, which begineth in the expiation wrought by Chriſt. 2. It diſtinguiſhed this Nation from others. 3. It exerciſed the people in confidence of God's Providence. 4. It much conduced to the fruitfulneſs of the fields, which, if exhauſted with continual tillage, would have grown barren, and ſo an evil report would have paſſed of the holie Land.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. The years of Jubilee had their Eccleſiaſtical, Political, and Chronological uſe. For 1. they ſignified the Jubilee of Grace and Glorie; both which Chriſt doth both proclaim, and confer upon his people. 2. They were a great help to the poor. 3. They preſerved the diſtinction of Tribes. 4. They ſerved to diſtinguiſh the times thence forth, from the diviſion of the Land, in the year of the World 2050 to the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> 5. They figured the Reſt that the Land ſhould have by the juſt judgments of God, for the ſins of the people.</p>

                  <head>SECT. V. <hi>Treating of Holie Things.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>HOlie Things, were either Common, as Oil; or Proper; and theſe again were either Principal, or leſs Principal. The Principal things were Sacrifices; the requiſites whereof were three: <hi>viz.</hi> fire, ſalt, and fat: the kindes of Sacrifices were ſix; <hi>viz.</hi> 1. A whole-burnt-offering. 2. An Oblation or Meat-offering. 3. A Peace-offering. 4. A Sacrifice for ſin of Ignorance, or Error. 5. A Sacrifice for wilful wickedneſs. 6. A Sacrifice of Conſecration. The leſs principal things
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115808:236"/>perteined either to all in general, as Firſt-fruits, tenths, vows, &amp;c, Or to the Prieſt peculiarly; as, Incenſ, Holie-water, Trumpets.</p>
                  <p>The application of theſe is thus.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Oil is ſaid to bee a moſt holie thing, becauſ uſe was made of it in the conſecration of the Tabernacles, Prieſts, and People. It ſigured out the oil of Gladneſs, that is, the gifts of the Holie Ghoſt, which Chriſt received without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and after that, by him, all the parts of the Church, both Paſtors and all Chriſtians; for all and onely ſuch are annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Oil of Gladneſs. Now this Oil was ſo made up of moſt pretious things, and the confection thereof by none to bee imitated, as might beſt ſet forth, that reprobates are not conſecrated with the annointing of God's children.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſire that came down from heaven, and was to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually kept alive ſignified four things. 1. The fire of God's wrath kindled and kept in by our ſins. 2. The fire of God's favor, whereby our ſins are conſumed in Chriſt. 3. The fire of the Holie Spirit's operation upon all believers; but eſpecially upon the Apoſtles and their ſucceſſors. 4. Laſtly, the fire of tribulation, which cauſſeth us to aſſpire towards heaven.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Salt of the Covenant was a ſymbol of incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that is, of perpetual continuance in the Covenant of God: And ſo it ſignified, that everie faithful Chriſtian is ſo confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the Covenant of God by Faith, that, by the ſalt of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, hee is preſerved againſt temptations and aſſaults of all ſorts.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Fat of the Sacrifices was holie to God alone: and hereby was ſignified, that wee ought to conſecrate our choiceſt things to God; that ſo wee may obtein the fatneſs and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs both of Grace and Glorie laid up for us in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. A Rite common to all Sacrifices offered up of living creatures, was, the ſprinkling of the blood by the Prieſt upon the Altar. Hereby was ſignified the blood of Chriſt, who, is both our Prieſt, Altar, and Sacrifice. Thoſe great drops of his blood, I ſaie, are hereby ſignified, wherewith believer's hearts (which alſo are ſo manie altars) are ſprinkled.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The whole-burnt-Sacrifice was an Offering whereby the Sacrificer teſtified that hee gave himſelf up wholly to Chriſt; and that hee believed, that Chriſt was his with all his benefits;
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115808:237"/>as alſo, that hee was all of a light flame with the fire of Charitie.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. In the Meat-offering, it was not lawful to offer leaven, or anie thing that leaveneth, as honie: whereby was ſignified, that corruption both in Doctrine, Life, and Diſcipline, is to hee put far away, if wee would offer up our ſelves to God.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. In Peace-offerings, leavened bread alſo was made uſe of: that together with our chearful praiſing of God, wee may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member our afflictions, the propertie whereof is to leaven the heart. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 73.21.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The Waving of ſom part of the Sacrifice in Meat-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Peace-offerings, ſignified, the continual motion of our lips in Praiers and Praiſes.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. The Sacrifice for Errors and infirmities ſignified, that all our ſins are mortal, and cannot bee pardoned, but through Chriſt alone.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. The Sacrifice of Conſecration ſhewed the difference between the Levitical Prieſts and Chriſt: <hi>viz.</hi> that they had need to offer for their own ſins; but hee, for the ſins of his people onely.</p>
                  <p>And theſe are the Cerimonial Sacrifices: all which ſignified the ſacrifice of Chriſt, and the ſacrifices of Chriſtians; (ſuch as are all their Moral works proceeding from Faith: <hi>viz.</hi> a contrite Spirit, Alms, Praier, &amp;c.) And laſtly, that offering up of the Gentiles mentioned by the Apoſtle. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.16.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, in all Sacrifices, clean things onely were to bee offered: whereby was ſignified the puritie of Chriſt and of all his members. Like as the offering of Doves ſignified, that dove-like ſimplicitie of Chriſt and his people: which ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie proceedeth from the Holie Ghoſt, who is alſo repreſented by the Dove.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Firſt-fruits were holie to God: and thereby, all a man's ſubſtance alſo was made holie. This ſignified 1. that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of Chriſt was the holineſs of the whole Chruch. 2. That the children of believing parents are holie.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Tithes, by Divine Cerimonial right, belonged to the Prieſts for their maintenance: but by Moral right they were holie to God; who by this means required to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the owner and giver of all good things. In the New Teſtament, Tithes, though they bee not
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115808:237"/>of neceſſitie, yet are they of perpetual equitie, as to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Miniſterie.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. The tenth of the Tithes (which the Levites out of their Tithes offered to the High-prieſt) ſignified the Prerogative of Chriſt; in whom wee are all tithed.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. The Cerimonial Vow, and the Redemption thereof, was part of the Worſhip of God: yet without opinion of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and Merit: this then make's nothing at all for thoſe that now adaies impoſe upon the people laws of Vows, and Redemption of Vows, with an opinion of Neceſſitie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and Merit. Vows are a ſervice pleaſing to God, ſo they bee made and uſed freely; as, exerciſes of Pietie, and as helps thereunto. The ſame may bee ſaid of things devoted.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. <hi>Novals,</hi> were the fruits of trees, which for the three firſt years beeing accounted as uncircumciſed, were in the fourth year offered up to the Lord: to teach us, that all our food is uncircumciſed unto us by reaſon of ſin, but is circumciſed by Faith in Chriſt; beeing received with Praying, and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. The holie Perfume figured the grace of the Holy Ghoſt, wherewith the ſervices of the Saints are ſanctified.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. The holie water of Attonement was a figure of that bleſſed fountain of Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s blood, ever running for the waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of the filth of ſin.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. The burning of the Sacrifices, ſignified Chriſt burnt in the fire of his Father's wrath for our ſins: but the burning of the garbage and excrements, ſhadowed out the crucifying of the old man. Laſtly, thoſe things that were not to bee burnt, noted the victorie of Chriſt, and of our faith.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. The two Trumpets of ſilver were uſed by the Prieſt for cauſſes Eccleſiaſtical and Civil. As to the former, they blew to call an Aſſemblie, and to rejoice ſpiritually; and this they did without an alarm. As to the later, they ſounded to go forward, or to go forth to battle; and this was don with an alarm. By all which was ſignified, the glorious inſtancie and efficacie of God's faithful Miniſters in reproving of ſin, in preaching the glad tiding of ſalvation, and in ſtirring men up to the ſpiritual warfare.</p>

                  <p>That which is to bee taken notice of in the general, is, that God would not approve of anie work but what was don by a ſacred perſon. To teach us, that good works pleaſ not God, unleſs the man that doth them bee firſt juſtified.</p>
                  <p>More particularly; Holie Perſons were either thoſe that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the Altar, or other holie Ones: Thoſe that ſerved at the Altar, were the High-prieſt, the reſt of the Prieſts, and the Levites. Thoſe other holie Ones were the Nazarites, and clean perſons. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>et us view them ſeverally.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The office of the Prieſt was to offer Sacrifice, and to praie for the people: hereby was ſignified the Merit and Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Conſecration of the Prieſts, and their freedom from all bodily blemiſh, ſignified the holineſs of Chriſt, both habitual and actual.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The holie Garments, and their ſtately braverie ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the beautie and braverie of Chriſt and his Church. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 45.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Annointing of the High-prieſt ſignified the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing and appointing of Chriſt to his office of Mediator.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The holie Abſtinence of the Prieſts ſignified the actual holineſs of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The High-prieſt was a lively type of Jeſus Chriſt, as the Apoſtle excellently ſet's forth in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> The other Prieſts repreſented our dignitie in Chriſt, and our dutie toward him. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1.5, 6. The High-prieſt ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed out both the Perſon and the Office of Chriſt. His Perſon, as hee was a man like unto other men, and yet ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to them in Office and Ornaments: which Ornaments did thus repreſent the three-fold Office of Chriſt. The bells and pomegranates hanging at the hem of his garment ſignified the Prophetical Office of Chriſt. The Plate of Gold, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon was engraven HOLINES TO THE LORD, ſignified his
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:115808:238"/>Prieſtlie Office. The Bonnet, Mytre, upon the High-prieſt's head, typified his Kinglie Office. Other ornaments common to the High-prieſt, with the reſt of the Prieſts, ſignified, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the gifts of Grace, and partly the Chriſtian Armor, which the Apoſtle deſcribeth. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. as conſiſting in the girdle of truth, the breſt-plate of righteouſneſs, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Thoſe twelv pretious ſtones in the Breaſt-plate, were a type of the old and new Church; that conſiſting of twelv Tribes, and this collected by twelv Apoſtles. Thoſe two pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſtones in the ſhoulder-piece, figured likewiſe thoſe two Churches, as they have the two Teſtaments. Thoſe two pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſtones in the Breaſt-plate of Judgment, the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> were a type of Chriſt, who is our onely Light and Perfection.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. There was but One High-prieſt: there is but <hi>One Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor betwixt God and man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. The Prieſts onely did partake of the Sacrifices; ſo Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians onely have communion with Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. <hi>Aaron</hi> bore the Names of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> before the Lord: So doth Chriſt his Church, and all the members thereof; for whom hee continually appear's in heaven.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. The binding of woven work ſtrengthened the robe that it might not rent: This ſignified the righteouſneſs and ſtrength of Chriſt for the ſalvation of his people, and ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his enemies.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. When <hi>Aaron</hi> entered into the holie Places, his bells gave a ſound: Hereby was ſignified Chriſt's Interceſſion for us, the Spirits making requeſt in us, and the dutie and propertie of all faithful Paſtors.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. The High-prieſt might not marrie anie but a virgin, from among his own people: This figured, that the Church was to bee preſented unto Chriſt as a pure virgin.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. The High-prieſt was forbidden to lament or to rent his garments: So Chriſt, after his Reſurrection obteined Glorie and Joie, without anie mixture of grief or ignominie.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. The Prieſts and Levites that ſerved at the Tabernacle, figured the Eccleſiaſtical Hierarchie; as it admit's of diverſ Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Degrees.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. The Nazarite's Vow was, to ſeparate himſelf unto the Lord by a ſpecial holineſs: Hereby was ſignified the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:115808:239"/>puritie of Chriſt, and withal his countrie of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> by an alluſion of name.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Thoſe that were Legally unclean (either by meats, or carcaſſes of men, or leproſie) were firſt ſeparated, and then cleanſed. In like ſort, all our ſins of what ſize ſoever, do ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate us from God, and ſom of them from his Church alſo; beeing all expiated in, and by Chriſt alone.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. The uncleanneſs of childe-bearing-women, ſet forth the filth of natural corruption.</p>

               <p>SHadowing Chriſt, as perfuming and preſenting the Praiers of Saints. <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3. and 5.8. and obteining anſwer thereto from the four horns of the golden Altar. <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.13.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>A cubit ſhall bee the length</hi>] That in <hi>Ezekiel, Chap.</hi> 41.22. is much larger, as ſetting forth the ſervice of God under the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>Overlaie it with pure gold</hi>] Shadowing Chriſt's Deï<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, yielding glorie to his humanitie. <hi>[A crown of gold round about]</hi> To ſhew, that Devotion is a rich roial virtue, beſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming the beſt Princes.</p>

               <p>Ver. 10. <hi>An attonement upon the horns of it</hi>] Pardon muſt bee ſought for the defects found in praiers; as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> craved mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie for his Reformations.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. <hi>That there bee no plague</hi>] <hi>David</hi> in numbering the people, neglected this dutie: thence the plague.</p>

               <p>Ver. 18. <hi>Between the Tabernacle and the Altar</hi>] The laver and Altar ſituated in the ſame court, ſignified the ſame; as the water and blood iſſuing out of Chriſt's ſide; <hi>viz.</hi> the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:115808:249"/>neceſſarie concurrence of Juſtification and Sanctification in all that ſhall bee ſaved.</p>
               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>For Aaron and his ſons</hi>] Here they were to waſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they praied for the people.

               <p>Ver. 30. <hi>Aaron and his ſons</hi>] Thoſe onely that ſucceeded him in the office of High-prieſt. <hi>Lev.</hi> 4.3, 5, 16. and 16.32.</p>

               <p>Ver. 14. <hi>For it is holie unto you</hi>] Hence the Hebrews gather (but falſly) that onely Iſraël was charged with the Sabbath-daie, and not the nations of the world. But the Sabbath was kept before Iſraël was born.</p>
               <p>Ver. 15. <hi>Whoſoever doth anie work]</hi> A certain Indian that had been taught by the Engliſh, coming by, and ſeeing one of the Engliſh profaning the Lord's daie, by felling of a tree, ſaid to him,

               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>Brake off the golden ear-rings</hi>] which they had got of the <hi>Egyptians. Exod.</hi> 12.35. To make uſe of Heathen Autors for oſtentation, is to make a Calf of the treaſure gotten out of <hi>Egypt.</hi>

               <p>Ver. 5. <hi>A feaſt to Jehovah</hi>] Whom theſe Idolaters pretended to worſhip in the golden Calf, as did alſo <hi>Jehu.</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10.16, 29. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11.15. and as the Papiſts at this daie: but with

               <p>Ver. 6. <hi>Roſe up to plaie</hi>] To dance about the Calf. Now, if they were ſo cheared and ſtrengthned by thoſe baneful bits, thoſe murthering morſels; ſhould not wee much more by God's ſpiritual proviſions, to dance as <hi>David</hi> did, to do his work with all our might?</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>For thy people which thou broughteſt</hi>] God will own them no longer; they are now diſ-covenanted. The Saints by groſs ſins may loſe their <hi>jus aptitudinale, non jus haereditarium,</hi> their fitneſs for God's Kingdom; they may ſin away all their comfortables.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. <hi>They have turned aſide quickly</hi>] <hi>Moſes</hi>'s back was but newly turned, as it were. <hi>I marvel that you are ſo ſoon removed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.6.

               <p>Ver. 9. <hi>A ſtiff-necked people]</hi> And ſo they are ſtill to this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie daie. <hi>Hierom</hi> complain's that in his time they thrice a daie curſed Chriſt in their Synagogue,

They counterfeit Chriſtianitie in <hi>Portugal</hi> even to the degree of Prieſthood, and think they may do it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the avoiding of danger, or increaſing their ſubſtance. There are verie few of them that turn Chriſtians in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt: <hi>Adeò in cordibus eorum radices fixit pertinacitas,</hi>

               <p>Ver. 10 <hi>Let mee alone</hi>] God is fain to beſpeak his own free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: As if <hi>Moſes</hi> his devotion were ſtronger then God's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation. Great is the power of Praier; able, after a ſort, to transfuſe a dead Palſie into the hand of Omnipotencie.</p>

It is the ingenuitie of Saints to ſtudie God's ends more then their own, and drown all ſelf-reſpects in his glorie.</p>

               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>Remember Abraham</hi>] Here <hi>Moſes</hi> neither invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Patriarchs, nor allegeth their merits, but mind's God of his promiſe to them, and preſſeth the performance. In the want of other Rhethorick, let Chriſtians in their praiers urge this with repetition, <hi>Lord thou hast promiſed, thou haſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</hi> Put the promiſes into ſuit, and you may have any thing.

               <p>Ver. 19. <hi>And Moſes</hi>'s <hi>anger waxed hot</hi>] Meekneſs in this caſe had been no better then mopiſhneſs.

               <p>Ver. 7. <hi>And hee ſhall ſprinkle</hi>] This led them to that blood of ſprinkling. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23. applied unto them by that hyſop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunch of faith, whereby the heart is purified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſhall let the living bird looſ</hi>] This figured (ſale ſom) that neither Chriſt's deïtie without the ſhedding of his blood, nor Chriſt's blood (but for the quickning life of the God-head, perſonally dwelling in him) could have been available for the purging of ſin.

<note place="margin">Ezra 10.13.</note> 
                  <hi>Even all his hair hee ſhall ſhave off</hi>] To ſhew that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and mortification is not the <hi>work of a daie</hi> (as hee ſaid in another caſe) but of a man's whole life. There muſt bee a dailie ſhaving and paring of luſts and ſuperfluities; which are to the ſoul as excrements are to the bodie. Yea, the more a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is exerciſed in mortification, the more hee ſearcheth out his corruptions.

               <p>Ver. 13. <hi>It is moſt holie</hi>] The waie of holineſs, in and by Chriſt is an abſolute waie, as ever was deviſed.</p>

               <p>Ver. 20. <hi>And the meat-offering</hi>] The meat-offering annexed to the burnt-offering ſhew's (ſaith one) either that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans grow marvellouſly in this life,

               <p>Ver. 32. <hi>Whoſe hand is not able to get</hi>] This is often urged, to ſhew, that the beſt can bee got muſt not bee thought too good for God: and that if through careleſneſs or niggardice men do not their utmoſt, that's a juſt exception.</p>
               <p>Ver. 34. <hi>Plague of leproſie in a houſ</hi>] Such is the contagion of ſin, that it will infect the verie houſ wee dwell in, the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wee wear, even all the creatures wee uſe, ſo as all things

The Papiſts have a ſaying, that a man would deſire to live in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> (a place of great pleaſure,) but to dye in <hi>Spain;</hi> becauſe there the Catholike religion (as they call it,) is ſo ſincerely profeſſed. And a heathen being asked, whether he would rather be <hi>Socrates,</hi> a painfull <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> or, <hi>Croeſus,</hi> a wealthy king? anſwered, that for this life he would be <hi>Croeſus,</hi> but for the life to come, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates.</hi> Thus all men wiſh well to Heavens happineſs: but bad men finde no more comfort of it, then a man doth of the Sun, when it ſhines not in his own <hi>Horizon.

And what a ſtrange hell-hag was that Queen, who when ſhe ſaw ſome of her Proteſtant Subjects lying dead, and ſtripped upon the earth, cryed out, The goodlieſt tapeſtry that ever ſhe beheld?

               <p>Verſ. 1. <hi>ANd keep, and do them</hi>] The difference between Divinity and other Sciences, is, that it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to learn, but we muſt keep and do it; as leſſons of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick muſt be practiſed; and a copy not read only, but acted. Man goeth forth to his work, and to his labour, untill the evening, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.23. He muſt ariſe from the bed of ſin, and go forth out of himſelf, as out of his houſe, to his work, and to his labour; working <hi>out his ſalvation with fear and trembling,</hi> until the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, till the Sun of his life be ſet.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>God made a Covenant with us</hi>] We alſo have the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, the ſeals, Miniſters, &amp;c. But (alaſs) are not theſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, amongſt us, as the Ark was among the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> rather as priſoners, then as priviledges, rather <hi>in teſtimonium &amp; rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam, quàm ſalutem?</hi>

               <p>Verſ. 6. <hi>I am the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] See the Notes on <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. It is well obſerved by a Reverend Writer,
<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Ley</hi> his Pattern of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> that the two tables of the Law are in their object, anſwerable to the two natures of Chriſt. For God is the object of the one; man of the other: And as they meet together in the perſon of Chriſt, ſo muſt they be united in the affections of a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>Keep the Sabbath-day</hi>] In this repetition of the law, ſome things are tranſpoſed, and ſome words changed: Happly, to confute that ſuperſtitious opinion of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who were ready to dreame of miraculous myſteries in every let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

Do every thing, as well as any thing: to leave one ſin and not another, is (with <hi>Benhadad</hi>) to recover of one diſeaſe, and to dye of another.</p>

It is anſwered, that they looked upon their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſafety, as a wonder; but feared what would follow, upon ſuch an interview, if continued. And indeed it is ſtill the work of the law, to ſcare men and to drive them to ſeek for a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 27. <hi>We will hear it and do it</hi>] This is well ſaid, if as well done. Many can think of nothing, but working themſelves to life; ſpinning a thread of their own, to climb up to heaven by. But that will never be.</p>

               <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>For my righteouſneſſe</hi>] We are all apt to weave a web of righteouſneſs of our own, to ſpin a threed of our own, to climbe up to heaven by; to ſet a price upon our ſelves above the market, to think great thoughts of our ſelves, and to ſeek great things for our ſelves. <hi>Coelum gratis non accipiam,</hi> ſaith One Merit-monger, I will not have heaven for nothing; and <hi>Redde mihi aeternam vitam quam debes,</hi> ſaith Another; Give me heaven, for thou oweſt it me.

               <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>Ye have been rebellious againſt the Lord</hi>] Nothing is ſo hard, as to be humbled; for man is a proud croſs creature, that would be ſomething at home, whatever he is abroad; and comes not down, without a great deal of difficulty. Hence it is, that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo ſets it on here, and with one knock after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, drives this naile home to the head, that he might cripple their iron ſinewes, bring their ſtiffe necks to the yoke of Gods obedience, and make them know that he was <hi>Iehovah,</hi> when he had wrought with them for his Name ſake; not according to their wicked wayes, nor according to their corrupt doings, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.43, 44, and 36.31, 32.</p>
